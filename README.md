# Sensor-node-placement
The placement of sensor nodes is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem to minimize the overall network cost (i.e. deployment cost) subject to the sensing radius constraint. Then, the best locations of installed sensor nodes and the optimal network cost (or equivalent to the number of installed sensor nodes) will be obtained.
